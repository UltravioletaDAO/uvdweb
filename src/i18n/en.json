      "paragraph1": "The history of Ultravioleta DAO began in March 2022 under the initial name 'Cuchorapido', a community created from live streams on Twitch. The initial focus revolved around Web3 topics, decentralized technology, digital consciousness, and the practical exploration of these tools in front of an active and participatory audience.",
      "paragraph2": "What started as a simple platform to discuss abstract concepts quickly became a dynamic space where the audience not only listened but intervened, proposed ideas, and made real decisions.",
      "paragraph3": "As the community consolidated, the natural need arose to organize through more sophisticated tools, leading to the launch of the first governance token, CRT, initially deployed on Polygon. This first stage served as a live laboratory, allowing understanding of decentralized governance processes through practice.",
      "paragraph4": "After two years of continuous growth, in June 2024 the community decided to take another step and formalize as Ultravioleta DAO, maintaining the original core but with a renewed identity that reflected its evolution. This change marked the definitive transition to a fully operational and established decentralized organization, with a new token called UVD, currently active on the Avalanche network."
